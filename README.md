#### (a) Introduction

#### (b) Design of system

#### (c\) User guide

`src/main.cpp` has a fully commented example showing how to use the system. Pre-built binaries of this file are included: `A2.exe` (for Windows users) and `A2.out` (for Linux users). To run them, open the root directory of this repository in a terminal, then run the executable for your platform. If none of these options work for you, the build scripts can easily be modified (they are only a few lines long) to support other compilers (such as clang) and flags.

##### Windows (msvc)

Build:  
*NOTE: Run this from an MSVC enabled terminal (such as `Developer Command Prompt for VS 2022`)*
```console
> .\make.bat
```
Run:
```console
> .\A2.exe
```

##### Linux (gcc)

Build:
```console
$ ./make.sh
```
Run:
```console
$ ./A2.out
```
